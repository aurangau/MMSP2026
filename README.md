## Abstract
Perceptual loss functions in Deep Neural Network
(DNN) deblurring architectures improve the overall quality of
restored images. However, few focus on explicitly targeting
sharpness in the restorations. We conduct a subjective study of
models trained with and without losses which explicitly target
sharpness using a four-protocol approach, exploring preferred
sharpness levels and effects on image quality. We introduce a
novel dataset of images with uniform sharpness increments along
with Difference Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS). Additionally,
we propose a novel class of Sharpness Informed (SI) Image
Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics which properly penalize over-
sharpening. Our new SI-PSNR metric outperforms all other
PSNR variants in terms of correlation statistics on IQA bench-
marking datasets. We show that, on average, images restored
using a sharpness-aware composite loss are preferred in 67% of
binarized comparisons, as opposed to losses that do not explicitly
target sharpness.

## Ablation Study on the selection of Hyper-parameters
The equation (5) in our paper is as follows:

$$
L_c = L(I, \tilde{I}) - \beta \cdot Q(\tilde{I})
$$

To produce sharper restoration during training, we may set the hyper-parameter value $\beta$ to either reduce the sharpness of the restorations or increase them. The following experiment was also performed as part of our work [1] where we examine the effect of $\beta$. This can be seen in Table 1.
| $\beta$ | PSNR (dB) | SSIM | $Q$ | LPIPS
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | **35.069** | **0.944** | **0.153** | **0.127**
| 0.001 | 35.102 | 0.945 | 0.152 | 0.117
| 0.01 | 35.101 | 0.945 | 0.154 | 0.117 
| 0.05 | 34.844 | 0.945 | 0.166 | 0.122
| 0.1 | 33.641 | 0.940 | 0.183 | 0.127

A visual example of this phenomenon can be seen below.
